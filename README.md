# Nick's 2023 Advent of Code Solutions
## Description
- Website: www.adventofcode.com
- Language I'm using:  Python
### Repository Structure
- One folder for each day 
- Within each folder:
    - `aoc_template.py`: the module that contains the code for parsing the puzzle data and solving the puzzle
    - `test_aoc_template.py`: tests
    - `example1.txt` (and occasionally more test data): the example data provided for each day's puzzle
## Principles
### General Principles
**AI is not used in any form or fashion** 
What fun would it be to have ChatGPT do my work here?  All of these problems are solvable without the help of AI.
## Programming Principles
These are constraints I've put on myself when solving the Advent of Code problems.  

## Apologies
**I'm not writing many tests (even though I should).**

**I'm not adding docstrings to my code.**
