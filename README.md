# Nick's 2023 Advent of Code Solutions
## Description
- Website: www.adventofcode.com
- Language I'm using:  Python
## Principles
### General Principles
**AI is not used in any form or fashion** 
## Programming Principles
These are constraints I've put on myself when solving the Advent of Code problems.  



What fun would it be to have ChatGPT do my work here?  All of these problems are solvable without the help of AI.
## Apologies
**I'm not writing many tests (even though I should).**

**I'm not adding docstrings to my code.**
